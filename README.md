## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com/) - React hooks library

### What I learned

This project helped me better understand the use of CSS grid and standard design practices. This was not a very complex design at all, however the individual pages required a lot of nuance and detail to ensure the design matched the required spec.

Additionally, as I continue to refine my method for form submission and validation, I opted to use a separated component to display the error message if a form field is invalid. This allowed me to much more effectively customize error message placement and content, as well as utilize conditional rendering so the DOM isn't as cluttered with unused components.

### Continued development

In future projects I hope to refine my use of CSS grid to eliminate the need for multiple media queries and simplify my CSS files.
